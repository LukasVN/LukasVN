-ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @LukkasVN

-ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in videogame development and programming.

-ðŸ“š Iâ€™m currently studying a videogame and virtual reality development course.

-ðŸ“š I mainly use and have the most knowledge of Unity.

-ðŸŒ± My main languages are C# (Mainly using it in unity but I worked a bit using .Net framework in blazor projects), Java and very basic C++ that I learned just messing around with Unreal.

-ðŸ’» This account currently contains my personal and class projects/activities.

- My Itch.io profile (Games): https://lukkasvn.itch.io
