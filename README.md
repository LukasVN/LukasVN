-ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @LukkasVN

-ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in videogame development and programming.

-ðŸ“š Iâ€™m currently studying a videogame and virtual reality development course.

-ðŸ“š I mainly use and have the most knowledge of the Unity Engine.

-ðŸŒ± My main languages are C#, Java and very basic C++ that I learned just messing around with Unreal.
