-ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @LukkasVN

-ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in videogame development and programming.

-ðŸ“š Iâ€™m currently on my second year in a professional training of Mult-Platform App Development.

-ðŸŒ± At the moment the only programming language that I'm learning is Java and C# because they are the ones that I have been using during my studies and working experience, but I'm looking forward to learn Unity/Unreal in the future and maybe C++.

-ðŸ’» This account will contain my personal and class projects/activities.
