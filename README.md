-ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @LukkasVN

-ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in videogame development and programming.

-ðŸ“š Iâ€™m currently studying a videogame and virtual reality development course.

-ðŸŒ± My main languages are Java, C# (Mainly using it in unity but I worked a bit using .Net framework in blazor projects) and very basic C++ that I learned just messing around with Unreal. 
    I mainly use and have the most knowledge of Unity.

-ðŸ’» This account currently contains my personal and class projects/activities.
